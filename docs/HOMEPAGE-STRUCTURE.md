### Claude Prompt: Homepage Structure & Layout (Hybrid SEO + Events)

You are a senior web strategist designing a **homepage structure and layout** for a **multi-location comedy club / live events brand**.

Your task is to propose a **homepage section outline and content strategy** that balances:

* Local trust and credibility
* Email list growth
* Long-term content value

This homepage should function as:

* The **primary authority page** for the brand

* A **clear entry point** to individual location pages

### Inputs You Must Follow

* Use the **provided style guide** for tone, voice, and messaging rules
* Assume the site already has **dedicated location pages**
* Assume events are the primary conversion action
* Do **not** write code, HTML, or CSS

If something is unclear, make a reasonable assumption and label it as such.
